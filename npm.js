//npm stands for the node package manager and is used to manage third parrty node packages. 

//nodemon helps us create a live reload server, preventing us from needing to cancel the server and rerunning it every time we make a change. 

// we have to run npm init to make a package.json file 

// and then also run npm install to install all the dependencies
